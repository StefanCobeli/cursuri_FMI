The authors propose a design of a new DNA vaccine against PRRSV. They
mentioned the basic ideea that it is necessary to locate the viral
targets that needs to be neutralized by the immunne system. 

</b></b>
The authors claim that they designed genetic constructs that contain
the genes encoding GP5 and
M proteins of PRRSV based on the plasmid pVAX1 vector (Invitrogen).
The sequence of constructs
is amplified using primers, cloned in the pVAX1 vector and transformed
into competent E. coli XL-1 Blue cells.
Restriction analysis confirms that the desired area is present in plasmids.

</b></b>
Finaly, the authors assert that they obtained E. coli XL-1 Blue strain
containing a plasmid vector
with genes of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus.

</b></b>
A drawback of the presentation is the complete absence of any
reference work in the area. Also, it would be nice to include a description of the effectiveness
of the vaccine comparing it with other similar ones.
